'''

Write a script that takes in a number in days from the user between 1 and 1,000,000,000 and convert it to seconds.

NOTE: We will use the input() funtion to collect users input. An example is demonstrated below.

'''

# the input of the user will be saved in the variable days.
# because the input() function collects the input as a string, we have to convert it to an int
# The string passed to the input() function is what the user is prompted with
days = int(input("Please enter a number in days between 1 and 1,000,000,000: "))

Fahrenheit to Celsius:

Write the necessary code to read a degree in Fahrenheit from the console
then convert it to Celsius and print it to the console.
    
    C = (F - 32) * (5 / 9)

Output should read like - "81.32 degrees fahrenheit = 27.4 degrees celsius"


Demonstrate how to:

1) Convert an int to a float
2) Convert a float to an int
3) Perform floor division using a float and an int.
4) Use two user inputted values to perform multiplication.

Take note of what information is lost when some conversions take place.
